  "gc-tasks-modal-text": "The GC Task Success Survey measures the performance of the Government of Canada web presence for visitors in three ways: task success, ease and satisfaction.<br>The survey helps center our work on visitor needs by:<br><ul><li>measuring how effectively digital content is serving visitor needs</li><li>receiving comments from visitors about their experience</li><li>identifying areas to prioritize for improvement</li></ul>Description of the main indicators in this survey:<br><br><strong>Task completion</strong><br>This is the percentage of respondents that said they were able to complete the purpose of their visit. This is calculated by dividing the number of completed responses who answered “Yes” in question 3 by all completed responses.<br><br><strong>Ease</strong><br>This is the percentage of respondents that said it was 'easy' or 'very easy' to do what they needed to do online. This is calculated by dividing the number of completed responses who answered “Easy” OR “Very easy” in question 2 by all completed responses.<br><br><strong>Satisfaction</strong><br>This is the percentage of respondents that said they were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their experience on the website. This is calculated by dividing the number of completed responses who answered “Satisfied” OR “Very satisfied” in question 1 by all completed responses.<br><br><strong>Margin of Error</strong><br>We use margin of error in this report as we are interested in metrics for the entire population of Canada.ca visitors, but it is not possible to measure everyone in that population. Therefore, we survey a smaller sample of the population and can then estimate the true score of a given metric based on the sample results.<br>The margin of error tells us how many percentage points our results will differ from the real population values, based on a 95% confidence interval. In other words, it tells us how good our predictions of the online experience indicators are expected to be.<br>For example, a 4% margin of error means that our statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time.<br><br>It is important to note that we have displayed the average of the margins of error for the three online experience indicators (task completion, ease, satisfaction) for ease of understanding.<br><br><strong>Data reliability</strong><br>This column in the report tells you how reliable the data is, based on the margin of error. Data with a higher margin of error is less reliable, as we are less confident that the observed scores from the samples are reflective of the true scores of the entire population. The margin of error tends to get less reliable as the sample size gets smaller or the variability of the sample increases.<br>The thresholds for data reliability are as follows:<ul><li>'Low margin of error/Reliable data' represents a margin of error less than 5%.</li><li>'Higher margin of error/Use data with caution' represents a margin of error less than 10%.</li><li>'Insufficient data' represents a margin of error greater than or equal to 10%.</li></ul>If the margin of error is greater than or equal to 10%, data for the online experience indicators has not been provided.<br><br><a href=\"https://design.canada.ca/survey/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">More info about GC Task Success Survey</a>",
